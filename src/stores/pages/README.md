## PageStore

`PageStore` is tailored for managing state and logic that are specific to individual pages or components of the application. It is more granular and focused compared to the `AppStore`, dealing with the UI state that doesn't need to be shared across the application. This could include form states, local UI preferences, page-specific data fetching, and temporary UI states like loaders, modals, and notifications.

Each page or a complex component might have its associated `PageStore`, allowing for a modular and organized state management approach. These stores can still interact with the `AppStore` for application-wide state or actions and use the `ApiStore` for data fetching or submitting.

For the blogging platform, a `ProfilePageStore` might manage the state of the profile editing form, including form validation, showing or hiding sections of the form, and temporarily displaying success or error messages after an update operation. It would use the `AppStore` or `ApiStore` to fetch the initial profile data and submit the changes.
